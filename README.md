# Scene Cleanup
A small script for cleaning up text copy/pasted from Discord, intended to help format scenes from roleplaying sessions done over Discord for saving or posting elsewhere (e.g. a forum). `config.yaml` should be edited with the Discord usernames of the relevant people, as well as any server tags that are in use.

Expects a plaintext file called `scene.txt` and produces a cleaned version called `cleaned_scene.txt`.
